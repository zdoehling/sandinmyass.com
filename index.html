    <div>Hey! Thanks for stopping by my travel blog. It’s nothing fancy, but I wanted a home to store some reflections about my travels. Even though I imagine many won’t see this, it’s always more fun to do something publicly where someone might just stumble in :D My wife and I work online, so we took the jump this year to visit Spanish speaking countries with the main goal to take classes and learn Spanish.

Medellin<br>
Stay September 15 - October 15, 2023
<br><br>
We just left Medellin a few weeks ago so the experiences are still fresh in my mind. In all honesty I was decently nervous about what we’d find as historically the city had a reputation for being unsafe. Even my buddy who lives in the US but has Colombian roots said it was brave for us to head to Medellin. They’ve really done a lot to turn around the city’s reputation and except for one moment walking home at 4am, we had 0 issues. Thankfully nothing happened that one time either, but I got the sense that this person who was asking for money started to change their tone from asking to threatening. Just as the dynamic shifted, a police motorbike turned down our road and the guy ran off so maybe we got lucky or I was just being paranoid.
<br><br>
I'm very glad that we went and didn't let our fears hold us back. We're already looking forward to coming back to Colombia to visit other regions in the future as each region boasts a different experience. We were able to make a close friendship with a few friends of friends, so it helped make the city feel warmer and it's always fun to look forward to seeing buddies again one day.
<br><br>
The highlights for me are certainly the beautiful mountains that surround this valley town and the incredible fruit. Everytime I looked out the windows of our Airbnb or any rooftop building you just see the huge mountains towering over each direction. I think the valley bowl intensifies storms too because I was jolted awake to the loudest thunder I’ve ever experienced. The neighborhoods sprawl up the mountains, so the metro system even has cable cars built into take you up the mountainside. I'd taken cable cars before but never as a transfer within the metro system itself!
<br><br>
And the fruit is incredible. I tried my first real passion fruit and later learned it's apparently uncommon to eat it straight with a spoon, but I loved it. So sour and then a huge burst of flavor. Even foods I'd eaten before packed more flavor too. I tried the best mangos and bananas I've had to date.
<br><br>
Where did we stay?<br>
We stayed in Poblado on Calle 12 where most of the tourists are. As it was my first time I opted to stay at the most popular area as it’d be easier to meet others and get a sense of the city. In the future I’d probably stay around Laureles as it’s cheaper and still has great food options.
<br><br>
I genuinely highly, highly recommend our AirBnb hosts Alexandra and Pablo. We’ve got no sponsorship with them or anything- just enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others. It was close to live music and good food just across the street, but the interior bedroom was quiet enough to sleep well. Pablo even came to the airport to pick us up free of charge just because he likes to be with his guests to introduce them to the city when he has the time to do so. Wifi was very fast too.
